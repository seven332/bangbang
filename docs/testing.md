# Testing Guide

This document defines how to add and run tests in bangbang. Prefer tests that
exercise project behavior through the narrowest public boundary that still
proves the change.

## Test Layers

Use unit tests for small, deterministic logic. Place them next to the code they
exercise under each crate's `src/` tree with Rust's built-in `#[test]`
framework. Unit tests are the right fit for parsers, error formatting, state
transitions, range checks, request validation, and backend-neutral helpers.
The `clippy.toml` test exceptions allow `expect`, `unwrap`, `panic`, and
indexing in `#[test]` bodies, but they do not cover ordinary helper functions in
integration-test crates. If an integration test needs those test-only patterns
in helpers, add a file-scoped allow at the top of that test file:

```rust
#![allow(
    clippy::expect_used,
    clippy::indexing_slicing,
    clippy::panic,
    clippy::unwrap_used
)]
```

Keep these allows scoped to test files, and do not use them in production code.

Use normal Rust integration tests when behavior crosses a crate or process
boundary but does not require Hypervisor.framework entitlements. Put these under
the owning crate's `tests/` directory. A PR may start by adding a new
integration test to pin the intended behavior before changing implementation,
especially for CLI, API, filesystem, or cross-crate workflows. The final PR
must leave the new test passing in the documented command set.

Use HVF integration tests for behavior that creates HVF VMs, vCPUs, GIC state,
mapped guest memory, signed test binaries, or guest boot execution. These tests
live in `crates/hvf/tests/` and must run through
`scripts/run-integration-tests.sh` so the binaries are signed with the
`com.apple.security.hypervisor` entitlement. Do not add real HVF tests to the
unsigned workspace test path.

## What To Cover

For CLI and API changes, cover successful requests, unknown options or fields,
empty values, duplicate values, malformed inputs, exit codes, HTTP status codes,
and Firecracker-shaped response bodies.

For host filesystem paths, cover missing paths, directories, unsupported file
types, redacted error messages, cleanup ownership, and failure atomicity. A
failed operation should not partially mutate accepted configuration, guest
memory, or host resources.

For guest memory, address, and range logic, cover exact-fit success, one-past
failure, overflow failure, overlapping ranges, and no-partial-mutation behavior.

For process, socket, and multi-bangbang behavior, cover unique resource names,
stale socket handling, shutdown cleanup, replacement races, and concurrent runs
where practical.

For HVF and FFI code, cover resource creation and destruction, platform gating,
error translation, unsupported exits or registers, cancellation, and cleanup
after partial setup failure.

## Stability Rules

Avoid arbitrary sleeps, fixed polling delays, and timeout increases that hide
races. Prefer explicit state, bounded channels, owned handles, temporary
directories, and public completion signals.

Tests must not share fixed global paths. Use unique temporary files or
directories and verify cleanup when ownership matters. Multiple tests and
multiple `bangbang` processes should not interfere unless the test is explicitly
checking conflict behavior.

Do not ignore HVF tests on hosts that support HVF. If an HVF test cannot run on
hosted CI, use the signed integration runner with `--allow-unsupported` so CI
still validates artifact preparation, compilation, and signing before skipping
execution on unsupported runners.

## Running Tests

Run the standard workspace checks before opening or updating a PR:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked --exclude bangbang-hvf
cargo test -p bangbang-hvf --lib --all-features --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --all-features --no-deps --locked
```

Run signed HVF integration tests on macOS Apple Silicon without
`--allow-unsupported`:

```sh
scripts/run-integration-tests.sh
```

Run one signed integration test target when the change is narrower:

```sh
scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --test hvf_lifecycle
scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --test guest_boot
```

Hosted macOS CI may use:

```sh
scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --allow-unsupported
```

That option is for CI-style build/sign validation on runners that cannot
execute HVF. Local Apple Silicon verification should omit it so unsupported or
misconfigured hosts fail.

## Guest Boot Artifacts

Guest boot tests use the pinned Firecracker arm64 kernel and a deterministic
tiny initrd. The integration runner prepares both when `guest_boot` is selected.
To prepare only the kernel cache, run:

```sh
scripts/fetch-firecracker-kernel.sh
```

The default cache lives under `.tmp/guest-artifacts`. Set
`BANGBANG_GUEST_ARTIFACTS_DIR` to use a different cache root. By default,
`scripts/fetch-firecracker-kernel.sh` stores the pinned kernel at
`.tmp/guest-artifacts/firecracker-ci/v1.15/aarch64/vmlinux-6.1.155`; when a
custom cache root is configured, the same relative path is used under that
root. The script verifies the pinned SHA-256 before reusing or installing the
cached kernel.

The `guest_boot` runner also generates a deterministic tiny initrd under
`.tmp/guest-artifacts/bangbang/guest-boot/` by default. That initrd contains its
own `/init`, so a rootfs drive is not required for the minimal guest boot
integration test. The test succeeds when the guest emits `BANGBANG_BOOT_OK` on
the internal serial console. The same signed target also includes a raw
virtio-block read scenario: the test configures one temporary drive whose first
sector contains `BANGBANG_BLOCK_READ_OK`, mounts `devtmpfs` from the tiny
`/init`, reads `/dev/vda`, and expects the marker to appear on serial. Rootfs
boot and guest writes are separate follow-up coverage.

## PR Expectations

Bug fixes should include a regression test unless the behavior cannot be tested
practically in the current scaffold. New public behavior should be tested
through the public CLI, API, crate, filesystem, or HVF boundary that users or
future code will rely on.

List only verification commands that were actually run on the reviewed head. If
a command is intentionally skipped, explain why it does not add useful signal
for the PR.
